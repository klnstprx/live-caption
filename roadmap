    Here are the areas I would address first if the goal is lower-latency, higher-throughput lecture
    translation while keeping the current architecture recognizable.

        1. Parallelise the long-running stages
           • Give STT and translation their own worker threads / async tasks instead of executing them in
    series inside the main loop.
           • Typical pattern:
             – capture-thread → queue-A → STT-workers (N) → queue-B → translation-workers (M) → queue-C →
    renderer.
           • The audio thread never blocks and the two network-bound stages overlap, hiding most network
    latency.
        2. Stream instead of “chunk–then–wait”
           • Whisper.cpp supports streaming fragments and returns partial words almost immediately;
    llama-style servers can also stream tokens.
           • Adopt the streaming APIs and forward tokens as soon as they appear.
           • End-to-end latency falls from “chunk length + two round trips” to “a few hundred ms”.
        3. Reduce conversation context size early
           • trim_conversation_history currently keeps the whole system prompt plus N messages.
           • For a lecture you seldom need the back-and-forth; keep only the last user utterance and
    (maybe) a running summary produced by the model itself.
           • Token count → prompt time → cost all drop.
        4. Stop re-encoding audio when you don’t have to
           • transcribe() converts raw PCM to WAV for every request.
           • If the Whisper server accepts PCM bytes (it does via /inference or /transcribe endpoints),
    send them directly – that removes a 2-3 ms wave.open() step and cuts memory churn.
        5. Re-use HTTP/HTTP2 connections
           • Create exactly one requests.Session inside WhisperClient, and one OpenAI client that is kept
    for the life of the program.
           • Turn on HTTP2 in requests (urllib3 >= 2) or use httpx – that lets the STT worker issue
    multiple requests on a single TCP/TLS connection.
        6. Tune VAD parameters for long speech
           • frame_duration_ms = 30 ms is usually enough; the current default looks ×4 larger
    (frames_per_buffer = chunk*4).
           • Smaller frames give faster VAD decisions and smaller end-pointing delay.
           • Also cap max_silence_frames to e.g. 15 (≈ 450 ms) so utterances are closed more quickly.
        7. Use numpy for padding / silence generation
           • pad_audio presently concatenates Python-allocated b\"\\x00\" * N, which is O(N).
           • With numpy you can pre-allocate a zero-filled array once and slice from it → less CPU, less
    garbage.
        8. Make logging cheaper
           • Lots of f-strings are evaluated even when DEBUG isn’t enabled.
           • Wrap them in logger.debug(\"… %s\", var) or use lazy= True pattern of structlog.
           • For high-throughput pipelines this alone can save several milliseconds per chunk.
        9. Gracefully degrade when services slow down
           • Put a timeout on each queue.get(); if STT or translation workers fall behind, drop or merge
    audio chunks instead of letting queues back-up and balloon latency.
           • Emit a metric so you know it happened.
        10. Configuration & observability
            • Expose all magic numbers (frame length, min_chunk_ms, trim length, temp) in pyproject /
    .toml.
            • Emit Prometheus counters or plain JSON lines so you can see RTT of every stage in Grafana
    while the lecture is running.

    Smaller code tweaks that cost little but help:

    • Add all lists and type annotations everywhere so mypy/pyright can catch easy slips.
    • Replace openai.types.chat import with plain dicts in hot paths to avoid the extra pydantic validation
     step.
    • Guard third-party imports (webrtcvad, openai, requests) with try/except and provide lightweight stubs
     so unit-tests don’t fail when those libs aren’t installed.

    Taken together these changes turn the pipeline from a strictly serial path into an overlapped,
    back-pressure-aware system that can keep up with real-time speech (≈140–180 wpm) on modest hardware
    while still producing high-quality translations.
